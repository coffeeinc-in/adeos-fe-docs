## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Choose your stack**: Select the appropriate tools based on your privacy requirements and technical needs
2. **Start small**: Begin with basic analytics and gradually add more sophisticated telemetry
3. **Privacy compliance**: Ensure all implementations comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations
4. **Data retention**: Set up appropriate data retention policies
5. **Monitoring alerts**: Configure alerts for critical metrics and errors

### Best Practices
- Implement proper consent management for analytics
- Use custom events to track business-specific metrics
- Set up automated alerts for performance degradation
- Regularly review and clean up unused tracking code
- Document all tracking implementations for team reference

### Testing Integration
Before deploying to production:
- Test tracking code in development environment
- Verify data collection in analytics dashboards
- Validate error reporting functionality
- Check performance impact of telemetry code
- Ensure compliance with privacy policies
