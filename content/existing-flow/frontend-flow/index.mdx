# Existing Flow Overview

This section documents the current file processing flow in ADEOS FE, covering the complete user journey from file upload to annotation processing.

## Documentation

- **[File Selection Process](/existing-flow/file-selection)** - File upload and page selection workflow
- **[File Processing & Annotations](/existing-flow/file-processing)** - Annotation creation, processing, and real-time updates

## Quick Summary

The existing flow consists of two main stages:

1. **File Upload & Page Selection** (`/extract` page)
   - User uploads a PDF file
   - System retrieves file metadata via FastAPI
   - User selects specific pages for processing
   - Selected pages are submitted for annotation processing

2. **File Processing & Navigation** (`/files/[fileId]` page)
   - File metadata is appended to local state
   - User is redirected to the file-specific processing page
   - Annotation extraction begins

<Callout type="info">
The current implementation optimizes performance by appending file metadata to the local state instead of refetching the entire files list from the API.
