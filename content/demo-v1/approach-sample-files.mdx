## Requirements

- **Static Storage**: Need to have 2 predefined files available under "All Files"
- **File Structure**: Predefined files structure in the frontend
- **Caching**: Backend cache with preprocessed static file data

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Implementation

#### Component Architecture
- **Dependent Component**: `FileList`
- **New Prop**: `type: "demo"`
- **Behavior**: When `type="demo"`, display predefined static files from cached backend data

#### Data Structure

The static file information will follow this standardized structure:

```typescript
interface DemoFile {
  file_id: string;
  file_name: string;
  format: string;
  uploaded_at: string;
  total_pages: number;
  selected_pages: number[];
  size: number;
}

type DemoFiles = DemoFile[];
```

#### Example Data
```json
[
  {
    "file_id": "demo_001",
    "file_name": "sample_document_1.pdf",
    "format": "pdf",
    "uploaded_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "total_pages": 25,
    "selected_pages": [1, 2, 3],
    "size": 1024000
  },
  {
    "file_id": "demo_002", 
    "file_name": "sample_spreadsheet.xlsx",
    "format": "xlsx",
    "uploaded_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "total_pages": 10,
    "selected_pages": [1, 2],
    "size": 512000
  }
]
```

### Backend Implementation

#### Caching Strategy
- Store preprocessed demo file metadata in backend cache
- Ensure fast retrieval for demo experience
- Maintain consistency with actual file processing pipeline

#### File Management
- Maintain 2 static demo files as specified
- Preprocess files during system initialization
- Store metadata in cache for quick access

## User Experience

### Demo Flow
1. User navigates to "demo" page where we have a side bar with a `FileList` component.
2. `FileList` component renders with `type="demo"` props
3. Predefined files are displayed from cached data
4. User can interact with demo files as if they were uploaded
5. Full functionality available without file upload requirement

## Benefits

- **Instant Access**: No upload required for testing
- **Consistent Experience**: Predetermined files ensure reliable demo
- **Performance**: Cached data provides fast loading
- **User Onboarding**: Easy way for new users to explore features
